 3) modifyStudent : it allow student to change their roll number {ID number }

 4) displayStudents : Add a feature to input a student's marks and display whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold (e.g., marks above 40 are considered passing)

 5) saveStudentsToFile : this should save the student's information that was added  e.g his firstname , lastname, we should Create  an array to store information for multiple students, with the ability to add, remove, and modify student records

 6) loadStudentsFromFile :  not useful for now 

 7) searchStudent : It allow users to search for a student by their roll number and display the relevant information
